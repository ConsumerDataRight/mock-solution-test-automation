## Questions
Our **issues** tracker is for issues concerning the Mock Solution Test Automation repository.  It is not for general questions about the Consumer Data Right or about the Consumer Data Standards.  General questions can be raised through the usual support channels, such as [CDR Support Portal](https://cdr-support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us).

## Pull Request Process
If you see an opportunity for improvement or identify an issue that can be fixed and you can make the change yourself, please go ahead. We follow a typical `git` workflow process for changes to the Mock Solution Test Automation source code.

1. Fork the Mock Solution Test Automation repository.  See [Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) on GitHub.
2. Clone the forked repository.
3. Create a new feature or hotfix branch.
4. Make your changes and push your code.
5. Open a Pull Request against the `mock-solution-test-automation` repository.
6. A member of the **Mock Solution Test Automation** team will review your change and approve or comment on it in due course.
7. Approved changes are merged to the `develop` branch.
8. A new NuGet package will be built and pushed to [nuget.org](http://nuget.org).
9. At certain points the `develop` branch will be merged to `main` and a new NuGet package will be pushed to nuget.org.

### Notes:
- We use a typical git workflow. Feature branches should start `feature/` and `hotfix/`.  
- Please make sure that you **ALWAYS** create pull requests for the develop branch.
