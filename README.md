# Consumer Data Right - Mock Solution Test Automation

**Note:** This repository is only relevant from version 1.1.0 of the [Authorisation Server](https://github.com/ConsumerDataRight/authorisation-server) and version 2.0.0 of the [Mock Data Holder](https://github.com/ConsumerDataRight/mock-data-holder) solutions.

Check [here](https://github.com/ConsumerDataRight/authorisation-server/releases) for the latest Authorisation Server version and [here](https://github.com/ConsumerDataRight/mock-data-holder/releases) for the latest Mock Data Holder version.


This project includes source code and documentation for the Consumer Data Right (CDR) Mock Solution Test Automation NuGet package.

It contains common source code that is used by the [Mock Data Holder](https://github.com/ConsumerDataRight/mock-data-holder) and [Authorisation Server](https://github.com/ConsumerDataRight/authorisation-server) test automation projects.

The project is built and packaged as a NuGet package and available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ConsumerDataRight.ParticipantTooling.MockSolution.TestAutomation).


**Note:** This project is designed specifically for use in [CDR Mock Solutions](https://github.com/ConsumerDataRight) test projects. It is not intended to be used as a stand alone testing solution as it is tightly coupled with CDR Mock Solutions.
